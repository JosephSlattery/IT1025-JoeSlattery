### Executive Summary 
In lab5 of IT1025 we will be covering Python Object Oriented Programing, UML, Data/information/knowledge, SQL and the ethical and  legal implications of information systems.

### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
The methods are swim and be_awsome. The property is the shark.

A constructor will initalize data automaticly when the object of a class is instantiated.

A class is an outline of an object defining what the object will do. An object is an instance of a class. Instantiating an object from a class is when an object is created from the class.

### Unified Modeling Language (UML)
OMG is a group who sets standards for UML in the industry. UML is used to visualize programs in a diagram displaying the classes, atributes and methods.

Object - Sammy 
Class - shark
Abstraction - definition of a shark
Encaosulayion - swim(self)
Inheritance - a specific type of shark

### Data, Information and Knowledge
Data is just single peices of information, information is several peices of data put together, and knowledge is what we learn from having all of the peices of data and information put together to get the big picture.

One table would have customerID and thier names and the other would have the customerID with the orders with a one to many relationship.

The pirimary key would be the customer's ID.
They would have a one to many relationship. The CustomerID will be tied to many orders.
The foreign key would be the customerID.

It is important so that we can narrow searches and find more specific information. 

##### Big Data
Volume - is the amount of data that you have 
Velocity - is the rate at which data is being collected
Variety - is the different types of data that is being collected

Banking, logistics, retail, e-commerce and social media have all driven the need for big data.

### Structured Query Language (SQL)
RDBMS is a database managment system that allows users to create and interact with sets of data. SQL is a language used to interact with data on a RDBMS.   


### SQL Injections

### Ethical and Legal Implications
##### Code of Ethics
##### Intellectual Property
##### Information Collection

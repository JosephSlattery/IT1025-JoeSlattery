# Data Representation
## Numeric Conversions
Decimal binary uses 0s and 1s (0-9) to represent a number where hexadecimal numbers use 0-f (0-15) to represent larger numbers using fewer characters.
## Hexadecimal Color Representation
This color code is used in an RGB color space. A color code is broken down into three sections- red, green, and blue. FF (255) representing red, 01 (16) representing green, and 6b (107) representing blue. The highest value that you can have for a color is 255, so red is 100%, green is 0.4%, and blue is 42%. These color codes are used to tell pixles on a display what combination of colors to combine in order to display the correct color.

## Pseudo-code
It's a code that uses normal/informal words in its language, making it easier to read and write. 
## Interpreted language vs. a compiled language
Compiled languages require a compiler to convert the code into your computer's native language. Python is an example of an interpreted language; Python does not require a compiler to convert the code. Python automatically converts the code into binary when running your code. 

# Career Exploration
I have found Information Security Analysts for an occupation that I am interested in from bls.gov. 
### College Central
I found an internship at Diebold Nixdorf and Goodyear. Diebold gave a pretty short description of what the job entails. Goodyear has a somewhat lengthy job advertisement listing what they expect and what they provide for people who are new to the IT field.

### Cybersecurity and Encryption
It would be my job to make sure that customer information is private and only accusable to them, information regarding products is always accurate and allow customers to access our website. 

For gmail I have to use my password, then the pin they give me on the Google Authentication application on my phone. 
My phone uses my finger print and it can require a pin to unlock along with the finger print scan. 
My home computer only needs a password to log into. I could get a RFID reader so that it requires my phone or an authorized devise (a card or fob) to log in as well.

ACL is when you have a list of users who you give individual permissions to. RBAC is when you create roles with permissions attached to them and you assigned the users a role.  ACL is very simple to assign permissions to users, but you must assign the permissions individually. With RBAC you can create roles with multiple permissions assigned to them making it easier to change the role rather than multiple permissions, a drawback of RBAC can be that you would have to create multiple rolls with different combinations of permissions. 

One person will write a message and their public key will encode it, turning it into ciphertext making it difficult for anyone who intercepts the message to read it. The recipient will receive the message and use their private key to turn the message back into plain text or its original message. 
With public keys we can send messages to anyone using them, but they can't be read without that person's private key that they have the only copy of. This way only the intended recipient can decode messages and it's less likely that the decryption key will be compromised.

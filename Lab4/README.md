### Cybersecurity and Encryption 

It would be my job to make sure that customer information is private and only accusable to them, information regarding products is always accurate and allow customers to access our website.  

For gmail I must use my password, then the pin they give me on the Google Authentication application on my phone.  

My phone uses my finger print and it can require a pin to unlock along with the finger print scan.  

My home computer only needs a password to log into. I could get a RFID reader so that it requires my phone or an authorized devise (a card or fob) to log in as well. 

ACL is when you have a list of users who you give individual permissions to. RBAC is when you create roles with permissions attached to them and you assigned the users a role.  ACL is very simple to assign permissions to users, but you must assign the permissions individually. With RBAC you can create roles with multiple permissions assigned to them making it easier to change the role rather than multiple permissions, a drawback of RBAC can be that you would have to create multiple rolls with different combinations of permissions.  

One person will write a message and their public key will encode it, turning it into ciphertext making it difficult for anyone who intercepts the message to read it. The recipient will receive the message and use their private key to turn the message back into plain text or its original message.  

With public keys we can send messages to anyone using them, but they can't be read without that person's private key that they have the only copy of. This way only the intended recipient can decode messages and it's less likely that the decryption key will be compromised. 

#### Cryptography 

The secret message was 'test' and came out as 'grfg'. All the letters were moved up by 14 since that's what I selected.  

The frequency fingerprint exploration tool shows what letters are most commonly used in the message compared to the letters most commonly used in the English language. This would not work with other languages since it is based on what letters we use in the English language.  

A polyalphabetic cipher is when you shift the letters in the message based on a secret word that only the sender and the recipient should have. Each letter in the secret word holds its number value and in order you shift each letter of the encrypted message by these values. This way each letter of the message is shifted by a different number, making it harder to find a trend and crack the encryption. 

Using the polyalphabetic exploration, I entered 'this is a test' as my secret message and 'test' as my shift word, making the secret message read 'nmbm cx t nyxm'. Each letter in the secret message was shifted by a different number according to my shift word. This makes the trend harder to find when looking for a frequency fingerprint. 

##### Brute-Force 

Brute-force uses every possible combination of letters to unlock the cipher and read the secret message. Kerckhoff's principle is that a cipher should still be secure even if everyone knows the method of encryption and hold a copy of the ciphertext. By this principle the Caesar Cipher isn't secure and can be easily cracked by brute-force, but when you are using a polyalphabetic cipher with a shift word or a key it can't be cracked without knowing what the key to the ciphertext is (like a private key).  

### Internet Architecture 

##### Internet Protocol 
IP addresses are numbers assigned to nodes and websites to help these systems communicate over the internet by using packets of information being sent between the IP addresses. IPv4 is an internet protocol that uses four seperate numbers separated with dots (each between the number 0 and 255). IPv6 is an internet protocol that uses hexadecamal characters seperated by colons instead of dots.  

ICANN is a nonprofit group who organizes and maintains RIRs around the world. 

##### TCP/IP 

TCP and IP are protocols that decide how data travels through networking hardware allowing nodes to communicate and access the internet. 

A client requests connection to an IP or a domain on a server, the server answers the request and sends data back to the client initiating a connection.

It would be my job to make sure that customer information is private and only accusable to them, information regarding products is always accurate and allow customers to access our website. 

For gmail I have to use my password, then the pin they give me on the Google Authentication application on my phone. 
My phone uses my finger print and it can require a pin to unlock along with the finger print scan. 
My home computer only needs a password to log into. I could get a RFID reader so that it requires my phone or an authorized devise (a card or fob) to log in as well.

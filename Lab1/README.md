# Executive Summary 
Lab 1 of this course helps students familiarize themselves with GitHub. We are learning how it can be used in an organization to help a team create and edit data for a project/task via the internet. We covered the history of the rapidly evolving world of computing and the components of information systems. 
# Information System Components
The price scanners that I use at work can be an example of an information system. I scan the skew of an item, the software on the computer then uses the skew number to look for the data or the price of the item located on a computer that houses all of this information. 
# GitHub
GitHub uses a client-server architecture. client-server architecture is when a company hosts a website or a piece of software on thier servers for users to access from thier devices over the internet without needing any additional software on thier machines. 
 
GitHub is considered cloud computing, because you do work on their website and it is all saved to thier servers rather than to a local machine, though that is still an option. You can log into GitHub from any machine and resume your work at any time without having to download or transfer files. Another example of a cloud computing environment is Office 365.

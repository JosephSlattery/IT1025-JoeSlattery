# Executive Summary 
Lab 1 of this course helps students familiarize themselves with GitHub. We are learning how it can be used in an organization to help a team create and edit data for a project/task via the internet. We covered the history of the rapidly evolving world of computing and the components of information systems. 
# Information System Components
The price scanners that I use at work can be an example of an information system. I scan the skew of an item, the software on the computer then uses the skew number to look for the data or the price of the item located on a computer that houses all of this information. 
# GitHub
### Client-server Archiecture
GitHub uses a client-server architecture. client-server architecture is when a company hosts a website or a piece of software on thier servers for users to access from thier devices over the internet without needing any additional software on thier machines. 
### Cloud Computing
GitHub is considered cloud computing, because you do work on their website and it is all saved to thier servers rather than to a local machine, though that is still an option. You can log into GitHub from any machine and resume your work at any time without having to download or transfer files. Another example of a cloud computing environment is Office 365. 
# Hardware
## Hard Drives and Memory
### Latency vs Transfer Rate
Latency is how long it takes for the requested data to be found on the disk. Transfer rate is the rate at which the data can be sent or transferred from one disk to another. 
### SSD vs HDD
HHDs require multiple complicated moving parts to operate, whereas SSDs use flash memory like RAM. HDDs can have mechanical failures due to thier design. HDDs go through a tedious prosses to retrieve data from the platter where SSDs can retrieve data almost instantly. 
## RAM
Having more RAM will make the computer faster by having more flash memory to store calculations instead of temporarily storing it in the local disk drive. 
64 bit data paths are capable of sending 64 bits of data at a time, so it's twice as fast as a DIMM with 32 bit data paths.
## ALU and the Control Unit
The Control Unit receives a set of numbers from the RAM and it is sent to the ALU. The ALU will add, subtract, or compare the numbers depending on the operation sent to the Control Unit. 
## CUP, Input & Output
When an item is scanned a number associated to the item is sent to the RAM (input) where that information is then stored, sent to the CPU to be processed, and then the information is sent to the display (output). 
## Logic Gates and Circuits

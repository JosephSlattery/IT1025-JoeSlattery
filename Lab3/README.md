# Executive Summary 
In lab 3 of IT1025 we will be covering operating systems, python IDLE, be introduced to graphics in applications like Lucidchart, and have a brief introduction to networking and it's components. 

# Python IDLE
The editor can be used to code programs while the shell is used to run those programs.
## A function 
A function is a command or a piece of code that we put into the editor to perform an action in our program ran by the shell. 
An example of this is "print ('Hello world!'). 
# Code Examples 
## Three data types 
## Variable 
A variable is a letter or phrase that you can give a value (x=2) or you can tell Python to recognize it as an input to give you a desired output (greeting= 'Hello'). Spam, bacon and eggs are used as an example in reference to a Monty Python skit.  
## An assignment statement 
An assignment statement is what we uses to tell Python the value or meaning of a variable is. 
x=2 
greeting='Hello' 
### Strings - A line of text (numbers or letters) that has no real value that will only print. 
'Hello' the output will be 'hello' or '1' + '1' the output will be 11 
### Integers- Integers are whole numbers that hold value. 
1+1 the output will be 2 

# Graphics
## Raster vs. Vector Graphics
A raster is an image that has fewer pixels making up the image. This makes the finer details of the image appear blurry and unusable when zoomed or cropped. These images are better when you need a small image that you aren't going to zoom in on or crop out a section of. 
Vector images are higher quality/larger images made with more pixels. Making it easier to see small details when zoomed or cropped. Vectors are pretty much good for anything. You can use them as is, crop out a section or zoom without compromising quality of the image. 
## Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
Lossless and Lossy compression also deals with image quality. If a developer wants to keep the quality of the original image, they can use lossless compression. If the developer doesn't care too much about the quality of the image, they can use a lossy compression method. This will result in a smaller file size and depending on the method the image will look almost identical to the original. 
## File Formats
Jpgs, gifs and pngs are all image file types. Jpgs are lossy file types that let you choose how lossy or compressed you want your image to be. Gifs can be a lossy file type, but it supports animated images. Pngs are lossless file types that replaced gifs for still images.
## File Properties
I made a logo for a LAN center with sort of an arcade design. There are twenty paths making up the ethernet port and letters. Some letters took multiple paths to make using the pen tool. 
The file size is 3.58KBs and it opens with Internet Explorer by default. You can change it to Google Chrome based on your preference. 
# Lucidchart
I found Lucidchart to be intuitive and easy to use while following the flowchart elements guide. 
# Introduction to Networking
## Data Transmission
Packets - Unit of data 
Packet-Switching - Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address  
IP Address - Unique identifying number  
DNS - Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com
Protocol - Set of rules to allow devices to communicate 
## Networking Hardware
A switch can read store mac addresses of the machines connected to it. This way the packets will only be sent to the machine specified. Where a hub will send the packets to every machine connected to it.
A router allows machines on a local network to communicate with other machines on a separate network over the internet. Hubs and switches only allow machines on the local network to communicate with each other and nothing more. 
## Network Topologies
A single point of frailer is when a network can't function due to its hub, switch or router no longer working. 
An infrastructure topology uses a router, a switch and a single wireless access point and a wireless mesh uses multiple wireless access points. A wireless mesh would be better because it is less likely to have a single point of frailer when one of the wireless access points goes down. 
## Network Design
On this network the router is connected to the wireless access point where the two computers and the printers will communicate wirelessly. 
## NSA/CSS
The NSA protects data that is important to the US government preventing hostile or untheorized people from accessing it. 
# Conclusion
In unit 3 I learned the purpose if a computers operating system, how to code is simple program using Python IDLE, how to make a graphic/logo using Vector and Lucidchart, the basic functions of a network and it's topologies.

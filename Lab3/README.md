### Executive Summary 
In lab 3 of IT1025 we will be covering operating systems, python IDLE, be introduced to graphics in applications like Lucidchart, and have a brief introduction to networking and it's components. 

# Python IDLE
The editor can be used to code programs while the shell is used to run those programs.
## Variable 
A variable is a letter or phrase that you can give a value (x=2) or you can tell Python to recognize it as an input to give you a desired output (greeting= 'Hello'). Spam, bacon and eggs are used as an example in reference to a Monty Python skit.  
## An assignment statement 
An assignment statement is what we uses to tell Python the value or meaning of a variable is. 
x=2 
greeting='Hello' 
## A function 
A function is a command or a piece of code that we put into the editor to perform an action in our program ran by the shell. 
An example of this is "print ('Hello world!'). 
# Code Examples 
## Three data types 
### Strings - A line of text (numbers or letters) that has no real value that will only print. 
'Hello' the output will be 'hello' or '1' + '1' the output will be 11 
### Integers- Integers are whole numbers that hold value. 
1+1 the output will be 2

# Executive Summary 
In lab 3 of IT1025 we will be covering operating systems, python IDLE, be introduced to graphics in applications like Lucidchart, and have a brief introduction to networking and it's components. 

# Python IDLE
The editor can be used to code programs while the shell is used to run those programs.
## A function 
A function is a command or a piece of code that we put into the editor to perform an action in our program ran by the shell. 
An example of this is "print ('Hello world!'). 
# Code Examples 
## Three data types 
## Variable 
A variable is a letter or phrase that you can give a value (x=2) or you can tell Python to recognize it as an input to give you a desired output (greeting= 'Hello'). Spam, bacon and eggs are used as an example in reference to a Monty Python skit.  
## An assignment statement 
An assignment statement is what we uses to tell Python the value or meaning of a variable is. 
x=2 
greeting='Hello' 
### Strings - A line of text (numbers or letters) that has no real value that will only print. 
'Hello' the output will be 'hello' or '1' + '1' the output will be 11 
### Integers- Integers are whole numbers that hold value. 
1+1 the output will be 2 

# Graphics
## Raster vs. Vector Graphics
A raster is an image that has fewer pixels making up the image. This makes the finer details of the image appear blurry and unusable when zoomed or cropped. These images are better when you need a small image that you aren't going to zoom in on or crop out a section of. 
Vector images are higher quality/larger images made with more pixels. Making it easier to see small details when zoomed or cropped. Vectors are pretty much good for anything. You can use them as is, crop out a section or zoom without compromising quality of the image. 
## Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
Lossless and Lossy compression also deals with image quality. If a developer wants to keep the quality of the original image, they can use lossless compression. If the developer doesn't care too much about the quality of the image, they can use a lossy compression method. This will result in a smaller file size and depending on the method the image will look almost identical to the original. 
## File Formats
Jpgs, gifs and pngs are all image file types. Jpgs are lossy file types that let you choose how lossy or compressed you want your image to be. Gifs can be a lossy file type, but it supports animated images. Pngs are lossless file types that replaced gifs for still images.
## File Properties
I made a logo for a LAN center with sort of an arcade design. There are twenty paths making up the ethernet port and letters. Some letters took multiple paths to make using the pen tool. 
The file size is 3.58KBs and it opens with internet explorer by default. You can change it to google chrome based on your preference.
